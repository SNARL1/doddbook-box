MYL frog-Bd Box

Box highlighting the Sierra Nevada Bd-Ranid journey.

Guidelines for Bd Box in the Amphibian Biology chapter on amphibian diversity and conservation in the Far West.

Develop a text file in doc format with a title, your name and affiliation, and tabbed paragraphs.

Aim for ~1500 words of main text and 2 images (fewer words if 3 images), and acknowledgments and references at the end that I'll pull out for the chapter's end matter.

The writing style should convey the key points of the 'story' in a logical format generally addressing background/context, findings, conservation implications. At this time we don't know the actual page sizes, so the word count is a best guess which I believe can be accommodated by enlarging or shrinking image sizes.

Tiff file formats are preferred for images with high quality/resolution, 300 dpi or greater. If you plan a collage of images, label as A, B, C, D, and submit the collage as a single figure with legible letters. Graphs are ok too, but make sure the font size is legible. Send the images as separate files.

Deadline is January 1, 2024.
